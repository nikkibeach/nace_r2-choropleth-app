### nace_r2-choropleth-app

A simple choropleth map visualizing Eurostat's employment data on the high-tech
industry and knowledge-intensive services, as defined by NACE Rev. 2 (data code
`HTEC_EMP_REG2`). The main goal of this project is to get my feet wet and
become more familiar with API requests, interactive geovisualization, app
frameworks and OS-level virtualization. The app was created using Streamlit
and Plotly and is deployed as a Docker container.

An exact definition of what comprises Eurostat's high-tech aggregation can be
found in its [Annex 3 â€“ Aggregations of manufacturing based on NACE Rev. 2](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/Annexes/htec_esms_an3.pdf).
